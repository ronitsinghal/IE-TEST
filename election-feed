A social activist, Dinesh Kalahalli, who claimed he was authorised by the woman’s family, later filed a complaint with the Cubbon Park police in Bengaluru alleging that the woman in the video clips was enticed by the minister with the offer of a government job. </p><p>On Wednesday Jarkiholi who denied any wrongdoing submitted his resignation on moral grounds through his brother and BJP MLA Balachandra Jarkiholi <strong><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/karnataka-minister-ramesh-jarkiholis-brother-seeks-cbi-probe-into-sexual-harassment-charge-calls-cd-fake-7212327/">demanded a CBI probe into the matter</a></strong>. "The allegations against me are far from the truth, an investigation is needed to prove the truth. Though I have faith of being proven innocent, I am submitting my resignation on moral grounds.

In his letter to CM <a href="https://twitter.com/BSYBJP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BSYBJP</a>, he says charges against him is not true and requests to conduct an inquiry.

Earlier in the day, Jarkiholi had appeared adamant over not quitting. "It is a conspiracy. It is a fake video. Will resign and quit politics if allegations are proven. Don't know this person or who she is, " he claimed in an early reaction to the scandal Wednesday. </p><p>Police are yet to register a formal case and are verifying the legitimacy of the complaint brought by the social activist, deputy commissioner of police M N Anucheth said following the complaint. </p><p>The CD featuring Ramesh Jarkiholi has come ahead of the announcement of bypolls to the Belagavi Lok Sabha seat which fell vacant last year following the death from Covid-19 of Suresh Angadi, the then Minister of State for Railways in the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre. </p><p>Jarkiholi is among four brothers who are active in Karnataka politics from the Belagavi region and is known to nurse an ambition to become chief minister. He played a key role in engineering defections of 17 Congress and JDS MLAs to the BJP in 2019. This had helped the BJP topple the Congress-JDS coalition government and come to power in July 2019. </p><p><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/show/0ygP4jm9c9SdqUM3C6DycM" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0"></iframe> </p><p>A bitter personal feud with current state Congress President D K Shivakumar — both were associates earlier — over control of the Belagavi region is believed to be the reason behind the collapse of the Congress-JDS coalition in 2019. </p><p>The BJP is wary of the alleged sex CD issue of the water resources minister disrupting a budget session of the state legislature which is scheduled to commence on March 4.</p>",

That sitting councillor won the recent Assembly poll on an AAP ticket. </p><p>AAP’s vote share was 46.10% in the five seats that went to bypolls; the BJP’s was 27.29%; and the Congress’s 21.84%. </p><p>There are 272 municipal wards in Delhi, and the elections were held for only five of those. However, the BJP’s loss at the Shalimar Bagh seat came as a surprise to many, since it is considered a stronghold of the party. </p><p>Similarly, the AAP’s loss in Chauhan Bangar, a Muslim-majority ward in North East Delhi which saw riots a year ago, has also raised questions. The Congress candidate in the area, Chaudhary Zubair Ahmad, defeated AAP’s Mohd Ishraq Khan by a margin of over 10,000 votes. </p><p>This seat was earlier held by AAP. The AAP losing the seat, and the number of votes polled by the Congress candidate, can be seen against the backdrop of the riots as well as the allegations of spreading the coronavirus against members of the Tablighi Jamaat, while AAP was in power in the state. </p><p>While AAP won the four other seats, BJP was the runner-up in all except Chauhan Bangar, indicating that barring a few select areas, the influence of Congress is still on the wane. </p><p> <div class="pdsc-related-modify"> <div class="pdsc-related-txt"><a href="https://indianexpress.com/section/explained/" onClick="ga( 'send', 'event', 'In_Story_Priority_Widget', 'Click', 'https://indianexpress.com/section/explained/' );"><span>Coronavirus Explained</span></a></div><ul class="pdsc-related-list"><li><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/how-to-book-a-covid-vaccine-dose-7210158/" onClick="ga( 'send', 'event', 'In_Story_Priority_Widget_Story', 'Click', 'https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/how-to-book-a-covid-vaccine-dose-7210158/' );"><span>How to book a Covid-19 vaccine dose</span></a></li><li><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-do-covid-19-variants-have-such-weird-names-7212143/" onClick="ga( 'send', 'event', 'In_Story_Priority_Widget_Story', 'Click', 'https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-do-covid-19-variants-have-such-weird-names-7212143/' );"><span>Why do Covid-19 variants have such weird names?</span></a></li><li><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/epigraph-software-coronavirus-vaccine-7211910/" onClick="ga( 'send', 'event', 'In_Story_Priority_Widget_Story', 'Click', 'https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/epigraph-software-coronavirus-vaccine-7211910/' );"><span>Software shows promise of vaccine against influenza, possibly coronavirus too</span></a></li></ul><div class="pdsc-full-coverage-link"><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/coronavirus/" onClick="ga( 'send', 'event', 'In_Story_Priority_Widget_Story_MORE', 'Click', 'https://indianexpress.com/about/coronavirus/' );"><span>Click here for more</span></a></div> </div> </p><p>BJP has governed the municipal corporations in Delhi for almost four terms now, and AAP has opened an aggressive front against it alleging it has indulged in corruption and mismanagement, and harassed the people. </p><p>While Wednesday’s results are heartening for AAP, the party has retained seats in their stronghold in East Delhi, lost one in Northeast Delhi, and won two in North Delhi.

Aerial and artillery bombardments have reduced cities to rubble. More than half of the pre-conflict population is displaced. Starvation is used as a weapon of war," he said. </p><p>Bozkir referred to the report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, released last month, which had said "the horrors of the conflict have left no Syrian family untouched." </p><p>Bozkir said the Syrian people have endured being held under siege, and suffered the effects, of chemical weapons attacks. </p><p>"Recent reports document the killing, torture, and inhuman treatment of people in Syria, particularly of those deprived of their liberty," he added. </p><p>Naidu added that the latest report of the Independent International Commission of Enquiry, in addition to highlighting the human rights violations perpetrated by the parties to the conflict, points to the internationalisation of the conflict due to involvement of influential states. </p><p>"The conflict in Syria is primarily political in nature. The fact that the conflict has been so protracted and intractable, points to the inevitability of a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process, preserving the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria," culminating in constitutional reform and free and fair elections. </p><p>"We call on all parties to the conflict to show political will and statesmanship to break the current impasse on the political track," he said. </p><p>Naidu also pointed the involvement of external actors in Syria has given a fillip to the growth of terrorism in Syria and in the region. </p><p>He described as extremely concerning the presence of 11,000 ISIL fighters in the North East and reports of radicalisation, training, and incitement in camps housing ISIL fighters in Syria. "It is imperative that all parties must adhere to their international obligations to fight terrorism and terrorist organisations in Syria," he said. </p><p>He stressed that the scale, severity and complexity of humanitarian needs should provoke the collective conscience of the international community, particularly those who advocate linking of humanitarian and developmental assistance to expected outcomes on the political track. </p><p>"We appeal for an assessment of sanctions measures imposed by countries on Syria since they considerably aggravate the current situation faced by the people, especially women, children, and the elderly," he said. </p><p><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/show/0ygP4jm9c9SdqUM3C6DycM" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0"></iframe> </p><p>The protection of civilian life is paramount, and the blatant disregard for civilian safety runs contrary to the obligations that all parties must uphold under international humanitarian law and international human rights law, Naidu said.</p>",

body: "<p>Authorities are investigating whether human smuggling was involved after a crash Tuesday involving an SUV packed with 25 people and a tractor-trailer that left 13 people dead and bodies strewn across a roadway near the US-Mexico border. </p><p>Most of the dead were Mexicans, a Mexican official said. </p><p>When police arrived, some of the passengers were trying to crawl out of the crumpled 1997 Ford Expedition while others were wandering around the fields. The rig's front end was pushed into the SUV's left side and two empty trailers were jackknifed behind it. </p><p>Twelve people were found dead when first responders reached the two-lane highway, which winds through fields in the agricultural southeastern corner of California about 201 kilometres east of San Diego. Another person died at a hospital, California Highway Patrol Chief Omar Watson said. </p><p>"It was a pretty chaotic scene," said Watson, who also described it as "a very sad situation." Roberto Velasco, director of North American affairs for Mexico's Foreign Relations Department, confirmed Tuesday on his Twitter account that at least 10 of those killed have been identified as Mexicans. No identities have been released. </p><p>The cause of the collision was unclear, authorities said, and it also was not immediately known why so many people were crammed into a vehicle built to hold eight people safely. </p><p>Watson said the SUV only had front seats —the middle and back seats had been removed. That would allow more people to fit into the vehicle but makes it even more unsafe. </p><p>It wasn't immediately clear whether the SUV was carrying migrants who had crossed the border, ferrying farmworkers to fields, or was being used for some other purpose. </p><p>"Special agents from Homeland Security Investigations San Diego responded ... and have initiated a human smuggling investigation," the agency said in a statement, adding that other details weren't being released. </p><p>Macario Mora, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, said agents were not pursing the SUV at the time of the crash, which was initially rumoured. The immigration status of the passengers was unknown. </p><p>"It was an unusual number of people in an SUV, but we don't know who they were," Mora said. </p><p> <div class="pdsc-related-modify"> <div class="pdsc-related-txt"><a href="https://indianexpress.com/latest-news/" onClick="ga( 'send', 'event', 'In_Story_Priority_Widget', 'Click', 'https://indianexpress.com/latest-news/' );"><span>Top News Right Now</span></a></div><ul class="pdsc-related-list"><li><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/karnataka-ramesh-jarkiholi-resignation-sexual-harassment-allegations-7212446/" onClick="ga( 'send', 'event', 'In_Story_Priority_Widget_Story', 'Click', 'https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/karnataka-ramesh-jarkiholi-resignation-sexual-harassment-allegations-7212446/' );"><span>Karnataka minister tenders resignation after sexual harassment allegations</span></a></li><li><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/vikas-bahl-anurag-kashyap-taapsee-pannu-income-tax-search-phantom-films-mumbai-7212309/" onClick="ga( 'send', 'event', 'In_Story_Priority_Widget_Story', 'Click', 'https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/vikas-bahl-anurag-kashyap-taapsee-pannu-income-tax-search-phantom-films-mumbai-7212309/' );"><span>IT searches premises of Taapsee Pannu, Anurag Kashyap, Vikas Bahl</span></a></li><li><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/disagreeing-with-govt-not-sedition-says-sc-farooq-abdullah-jammu-kashmir-article-370-7212276/" onClick="ga( 'send', 'event', 'In_Story_Priority_Widget_Story', 'Click', 'https://indianexpress.com/article/india/disagreeing-with-govt-not-sedition-says-sc-farooq-abdullah-jammu-kashmir-article-370-7212276/' );"><span>Disagreeing with govt not sedition: Supreme Court</span></a></li></ul><div class="pdsc-full-coverage-link"><a href="https://indianexpress.com/latest-news/" onClick="ga( 'send', 'event', 'In_Story_Priority_Widget_Story_MORE', 'Click', 'https://indianexpress.com/latest-news/' );"><span>Click here for more</span></a></div> </div> </p><p>The people in the vehicle ranged in age from 15 to 53 and were a mix of males and females, officials said. The 28-year-old driver was from Mexicali, Mexico, just across the border, and was among those killed. The 68-year-old driver of the big rig, who is from nearby El Centro, was hospitalised with moderate injuries. </p><p>The passengers' injuries ranged from minor to severe and included fractures and head trauma. They were being cared for at several hospitals. One person was treated at a hospital and released. </p><p>The crash occurred around 6:15 a.m. at an intersection just outside Holtville, which dubs itself the world's carrot capital and is about 11 miles (18 kilometers) north of the U.S.-Mexico border. It was a sunny, clear morning and authorities said the tractor-trailer and its two empty containers were northbound on State Highway 115 when the SUV pulled in front of it from Norrish Road. </p><p>A California Highway Patrol report said the SUV entered an intersection directly in front of the big-rig, which hit the left side of the SUV. Both vehicles came to a halt on a dirt shoulder. </p><p>It's not clear if the SUV ran a stop sign or had stopped before entering the highway. It's also not yet known how fast the tractor-trailer was traveling. </p><p>The speed limit for tractor-trailers on the highway is 55 mph (88.5 kph), according to CHP Officer Jake Sanchez. The other road is also 55 mph for vehicles. </p><p>A 1997 Ford Expedition can carry a maximum payload of 2,000 pounds. If it had 25 people inside, that would easily exceed the payload limit, which taxes the brakes and makes it tougher to steer, said Frank Borris, former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Office of Defects Investigation. </p><p>"You're going to have extended stopping distances, delayed reactions to steering inputs and potential over-reaction to any type of high-speed lane change," said Borris, who now runs a safety consulting business. </p><p>SUVs of that age tended to be top-heavy even without carrying a lot of weight, Borris said. </p><p>"With all of that payload above the vehicle's center of gravity, it's going to make it even more unstable," he said. </p><p>The crash occurred amid verdant farms that grow a wide variety of vegetables and alfalfa used for cattle feed. </p><p>Thousands of people cross into the US each day to work in the fields. The harvest of lettuce and other winter vegetable crops runs from November until March, and buses and SUVs carrying farmworkers are often rumbling down the rural roads s in the early morning hours. </p><p><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/show/0ygP4jm9c9SdqUM3C6DycM" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0"></iframe> </p><p>The area has also seen smugglers carrying migrants in trucks and vehicles. Hundreds of migrants who died after crossing the border are buried in unmarked graves in Holtville's cemetery on the edge of town. (AP)</p>",

body: "<p><em><strong>Written by Elaina Plott</strong></em> </p><p>Theoretically, Sen. Tom Cotton was hitting the right notes. </p><p>Midway through his speech to hundreds of conservative activists Friday, Cotton, a R-Ark., channeled former President Donald Trump as he castigated President Joe Biden’s immigration policies. “They have halted deportations for all illegal aliens,” Cotton said gravely, and falsely. “Murderers, rapists, terrorists, MS-13 gang members are not being deported.” </p><p>His cadence quickened: “They stopped building a wall around our border, and they put up a wall around your United States Capitol.” He thundered on: “And right now,” he said misleadingly, “right now, as we speak, they are literally tracking down illegal aliens in Mexico who Donald Trump turned away, to invite them to come back.” </p><p>Finally, the big reveal: “That’s not catch-and-release,” Cotton intoned, “that’s <em>recruit</em>-and-release!” </p><p>And then — nothing. </p><p>Well, almost nothing. A few polite titters rippled through the ballroom. But in the half-second of awkward energy that followed, it seemed clear that Cotton’s wordplay — his attempt to repurpose Biden’s reversal of a Trump-era policy on asylum-seekers as a quippy, critical slogan — had not landed as he had hoped. </p><p>For ambitious Republicans like Cotton who are mulling a presidential bid, a challenging and at times uncomfortable audition is underway this winter: trying to use the Trump political playbook to impress and inherit the former president’s supporters — all while navigating the limitation of not being Trump. </p><p>Some Republicans have been using appearances on Fox News and far-right news outlets to test messages and hone their political pitches, as well as firing off social media posts and delivering remarks at the Capitol to try to engage the right. Last weekend’s annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, where Cotton and other Republican leaders-in-waiting spoke, was the most visible stage yet for these politicians — not to mention where they confronted the most scrutiny. </p><p>CPAC has typically represented a small slice of the Republican electorate, but in the past four years, as Trump’s polarizing leadership prompted a slew of defections by more moderate party members, the gathering has become a closer reflection of the party’s base. </p><p>And in interviews, dozens of attendees signaled the contradictions that future presidential candidates would need to embody to win their support. The attendees said they were most drawn to Republicans who both pledged fealty to Trump and appeared to showcase a distinct political identity — figures like Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida; Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota; Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri; and Mike Pompeo, the former secretary of state. </p><p>And while they expected the party’s next star to be a “fighter” in the mold of Trump, they also bristled at speakers who seemed as if they were trying to mimic him outright — like Cotton and Sen. Rick Scott of Florida. </p><p>“It’s like Hellmann’s mayonnaise — you can’t imitate it, man,” said Waverly Woods, 54, a Republican activist from Virginia Beach, Virginia. “You’re either real mayonnaise, or you’re not.” </p><p>Much of Cotton’s CPAC address seemed like imitation, with the senator invoking many of the grievances popularized by Trump — “cancel culture,” critical race theory — yet struggling to elicit the same emotional response. </p><p>Cotton, who notched 1 percentage point in the conference’s non-Trump straw poll of possible 2024 presidential candidates, was not the only Republican hopeful who struggled to resonate, despite adopting Trump’s language. Even on his home turf, Scott, who governed the state from 2011-19 and recently became the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, appeared to gain little traction. </p><p>During his 17-minute address Friday, Scott, a former venture capitalist whose net worth is in the hundreds of millions of dollars, took aim at the establishment, gender pronouns and “safe spaces” before moving on to China. He referred to the moment shortly after the election when President Xi Jinping congratulated Biden and expressed hope for a “win-win” relationship. </p><p>“Oh, there’s going to be a ‘win-win,’ ” Scott said. “Hunter Biden’s going to win and get richer” — and here Scott paused for a reaction that never came — “as Communist China wins and becomes the most powerful country in the world.” </p><p>As with Cotton, none of those interviewed regarded Scott negatively; most people, and even some Floridians who said they had voted for him in 2018, simply strained to remember him. But their apathy toward such politicians was a function of more than any one personal drawback. With 95% of CPAC attendees indicating their continued support for Trump’s agenda, expressions of solidarity were not exceptional but expected. As a result, many people flocked last weekend to Republicans who offered another dimension to their pitch. </p><p>Harrison Rogers, an entrepreneur from Arizona, said that conservatives were “over” pro-Trump talk alone. “Show us what you’re actually doing,” he said, “rather than just saying you can stand up to the media and stand up to the whoever.” </p><p>During an event marked by steady gripes about mask-wearing, DeSantis and Noem were almost guaranteed to resonate. As governor of Florida, DeSantis has been an outspoken advocate of keeping schools and businesses open during the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/pandemic-explained-who-novel-coronavirus-covid19-what-is-a-pandemic-6309727/">pandemic</a>. </p><p>Noem also shot to prominence in Republican circles for refusing to enforce a statewide mask mandate, stay-at-home orders or business closures in South Dakota. Both were the non-Trump favorites in the conference’s straw poll. </p><p>Rogers, 32, said he was “star-struck” when he saw DeSantis and Noem up close. “They’re governors that really handled last year courageously and very unpopularly as far as what the media kind of expected,” he said. “And for them to come out and just continue to stick with their beliefs — they showed that you don’t have to be terrified when the nation and the media are pointing out your potential risks or bad decisions.” </p><p>“Cancel culture is real,” Rogers added. </p><p>Roughly a year after the emergence of the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/coronavirus/">coronavirus</a> in the United States, South Dakota has the eighth-highest death rate in the country, and more than 1 in 500 residents have died of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/coronavirus/">COVID-19</a>. But at CPAC, Noem was given a hero’s welcome. </p><p>“Oh, my whole family loves Kristi — sort of like with Ron,” Conner Dyess, 18, who traveled to Orlando from Jackson, Mississippi, said at the conclusion of his first CPAC. “She’s put the power of being able to choose and trust in her people,” he went on. “She’s just a rising star.” </p><p>Armed with more than just a senator’s voting record, governors often have an early edge in presidential contests. But in a moment when almost every prominent Republican — from governors to lawmakers to Fox News personalities — has adopted Trump’s pledge to “fight,” conservative attendees said they now wanted tales from the front lines. </p><p>It was the difference between the dutiful laughter when Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas cracked jokes about wearing masks in restaurants, and the uproarious applause when Noem boasted about refusing to shut down her state. She had not just criticized the recommendations of infectious-disease experts like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci; she had actively defied them. </p><p>Hawley made strides this weekend for similar reasons. While Hawley, the junior senator from Missouri, also delivered riffs on cancel culture and immigration, he distinguished himself by reminding the audience of his objection to the Electoral College certification of Biden’s victory. He framed himself as a martyr, describing how a “woke mob” had tried to “cancel me, censor me, expel me, shut me down.” </p><p>For Dyess, the speech affirmed his belief that Hawley had a “backbone.” He also appreciated that the senator seemed to have the right enemies: “You know,” he said, “the media is now really on Josh Hawley.” </p><p>Pompeo had the advantage of being one of the few Trump administration officials on the agenda at CPAC. Former Vice President Mike Pence and Nikki Haley, Trump’s former ambassador to the United Nations, both declined to attend. While some attendees shrugged at their absence, others said they would have appreciated hearing from Pence. </p><p>“I do think he should’ve stood up for Trump,” said Mindy Salinas, 41, a CPAC volunteer and a member of the Los Angeles Hispanic Republican Club, referring to Trump’s urging his vice president not to certify Biden’s election, a constitutional duty. “But it would’ve been nice for him to give his views on what life was like being vice president of our country.” </p><p>Pompeo, who served as both secretary of state and CIA director, thus had a wide berth for emphasizing his role in an administration that he argued had “truly upended the status quo.” </p><p>Woods said she liked that Pompeo seemed to be “his own man.” </p><p>“He is a very strong alpha male that’s not going to put up with any shenanigans,” she added. </p><p>Yet even as dozens of CPAC attendees described their favorite speakers in terms of their independence from Trump, almost all were quick to clarify their preference for the man himself. </p><p>Rogers said that he, like other Trump supporters, had been relieved to finally hear from the former president after weeks of quiet since he left office. “I just feel like we needed some clarity and direction, and we got it.” </p><p>In other words, Woods said, their leader was back. “It was one of my favoritest CPACs ever!” she gushed. “My first reaction about this CPAC is Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, TRUMP!”</p>",
